Why returns data and not object value?

Chapter 1 Python done;
For the following chapters, I will only try odd questions in python.
For the second round, I should try even questions in C.


Next:

Theory:
search permutation for more than 3 chars
hash table for resizable array

Practice:
Singly list remove from tail
test doubly list
doubly list remove from head
doubly list remove from tail
hash table for resizable array
build ArrayList
Finite series for big O
build StringBuilder

C -> Chapter1:
urlify, string buffers
permutation_polindrome bit vector
string rotation skipped
